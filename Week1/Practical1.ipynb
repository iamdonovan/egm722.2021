    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "As we discussed in this week's lecture, programming is a powerful tool that allows us to do complicated calculations and analysis, visualize data, and automate workflows to ensure consistency, accuracy, and reproducability in our research. In this practical, you will learn and practice basic commands in python and import modules to complete more complicated tasks. In the weeks to come, you will learn to work with different GIS datasets such as vector (e.g., shapefiles) or raster files using python libraries.\n",

    "## Objectives\n",

Variables store temporary information that can be manipulated or changed as we type commands or run scripts. In practice, variables can refer to almost anything. As our chosen name suggests, __myString__ is a __string__, or text. Variables can also be __int__egers, __float__ing point numbers (floats or decimal numbers), __list__s, __tuple__, __dict__ionaries, entire files, and many more possibilities. In python, variable names can consist of letters, digits, or underscores, but they __cannot__ begin with a digit.\n",

    "We have already worked with one example of a __str__ing variable, __myString__. We will often use strings to indicate paths and filenames in scripts, so it will be good to understand how we can manipulate and work with strings. As noted in lecture, we can easily access parts of a string by calling indices. For example, to get the 3rd character in __myString__, we would type the command `myString[2]` at the prompt and press ENTER. Why does this command give us the third character from __myString__? Remember that the first element of a string (or any sequence; more on that later) has an index of 0. \n",

    "To access the last element of a string (or a sequence), we could count up all of the elements of the string and subtract one (remember that we started at 0, not 1), but python gives us an easier way: __negative indexing__. Thus, to get the last element of __myString__, we can type `myString[-1]`. To get the second-to-last element, we could type `myString[-2]`, and so on.\n",

    "## 6. Functions and Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "In python, a function is essentially a short program that we can use to perform a specific action. Functions take in __parameters__ in the form of __arguments__, and (often, but not always) return a result, or otherwise perform an action. Parameters can be positional (i.e., the order they are given matters), or they can be __keyword__ (i.e., you specify the argument with the parameter name, in the form `parameter=value`). \n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a number of built-in functions for us to use. For example, instead of typing `2 ** 8` earlier, we could instead have typed __pow(2,8)__. Here, we are calling the function __pow__ and supplying the __positional__ arguments `2` and `8`. The result returned is the same, `256` (or 2<sup>8</sup>), but the approach used is different. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to see a list of built-in functions in python, you can type `print(dir(__builtins__))` (note the two underscores on either side of __builtins__). It may not be completely clear at first what each of these functions do, but remember that we can use the __help__ function to get more information. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, one very useful built-in function is range, which takes three (optional) parameters: `range([start,] stop [,step])`. To pass multiple parameters to a function, we separate each parameter by a comma. Optional parameters are shown in square brackets. As you may have guessed (or seen from the help information), __range__ returns a list of values from `start` to (but not including) `stop`, spaced by `step`. By default, the range starts at 0 and increments by 1, so that __range(5)__ returns `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`. \n",

For example, strings have a method called __count__, which counts the number of times a character (or substring) occurs in a string.

This also means that we only end up loading the functionality that we need, which helps save on memory and other resources. We have already imported one such module, the __sys__ module. Another useful module to use is the __math__ module, which provides much more than the built-in operators we explored earlier. Run the following cell. "

You should also notice that we can import a whole module (`import math`) or import an attribute, class, or function from a module (`from math import pi`). When we specifically name the things we want to import, we only have access to those things - importing __pi__ from __math__ does not also import __floor__ - hence, the error message. It is also possible to import all of the functions and classes from a given module (`from math import *`), but this is not really recommended - why do you think this is?\n",

    "Here, we see a number of lake names, with accompanying data such as the lake area (presumably in square kilometers?), the maximum depth (missing for some lakes), Lat/Lon information, and so on. Remember that a `GeoDataFrame` can hold lots of different data, but it needs a column that specifies the geometry of a feature. Given that we only have point information (a single Lat/Lon coordinate) for each lake, it makes sense to create a `Point` object for each feature using that point. We can do this by first using the python built-in __zip__, then the __apply__ method of the `DataFrame` to create a point object from the list of coordinates."
